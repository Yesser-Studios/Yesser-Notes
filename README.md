# Yesser Notes (formerly yNotes)
The lightweight notes app for your short note-taking needs, made by Yesser Studios.

This is the official repository for Yesser Notes.

## Description
Take short plain text notes, read them later, or export them to a text file.

Exported files are readable, so you can send them to your friends who don't have the app!
Or they can download this app and import the notes you sent them.

Everything works and is stored on your PC, nothing is uploaded anywhere.

Dark mode support:
The app will copy the system's dark mode setting and accent color, changes will apply even at runtime.
